# Solubility Predictor

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the solubility of chemical compounds based on their molecular structure.

## Overview

The goal is to classify molecules as soluble or insoluble using a dataset of chemical descriptors. The process includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using common machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
- Model training using Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy and ROC AUC
- Simple visualization of model performance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `solubility_predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Load the dataset (CSV format expected).
4. Run the notebook cells in order to train and evaluate the model.

## Notes

- The dataset should include numerical molecular descriptors and a binary solubility label.
- Code is written for readability and demonstration, not production deployment.
